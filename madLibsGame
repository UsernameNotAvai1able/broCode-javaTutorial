//while this is just a copy of the project in the video. I am keeping these mostly to refer to them in the future, if I forget finer details of using java.
//chapter 4 of the 12 hour video. the previous 3 are mostly for introducing you to the concepts of things like variables and scanners. this is the first project building on those concepts
//feel free to reach out with questions/comments

        String noun1; //person, place, or thing
